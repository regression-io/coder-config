Think of Claude Config as your **control center** for Claude Code (and other AI coding tools). Instead of manually editing JSON files or remembering command-line flags, you get a friendly UI to manage everything.

### How are you using Claude Config?

**Desktop App** - Downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/regression-io/claude-config/releases). No terminal needed!

**npm Package** - Installed via \`npm install -g @regression-io/claude-config\` and running \`claude-config ui\`.

Both work identically - this tutorial applies to either.

### What can you do here?

- **Register projects** you're working on
- **Add rules** that tell Claude how to behave in each project
- **Configure MCP servers** to give Claude superpowers (database access, file operations, etc.)
- **Set permissions** to control what Claude can do automatically
- **Manage memory** so Claude remembers important things
- **Install plugins** for pre-built configurations

### Who is this for?

Anyone using Claude Code! Whether you're:
- A developer wanting more control over Claude's behavior
- Working on multiple projects with different requirements
- Using Claude with other tools like Gemini CLI

Let's get started!

5. **Use memory** - Help Claude remember things across sessions
6. **Install plugins** - Get pre-built configurations

### Advanced
7. **Create workstreams** - Manage multi-project workflows
8. **Multi-tool support** - Use with Gemini CLI and Antigravity

### How long will this take?

Each section takes about **5 minutes**. You can stop anytime and pick up where you left off.
